## Who I Am

Hi! I'm **Himanshu**, an Applied Scientist at **Amazon Ads**, based in Bengaluru.

I explore the intersection of **robotics, computer vision, and machine learning** — designing intelligent systems that learn from perception and interact with the world in meaningful ways.  

Before Amazon, I spent my time working on **robotic manipulators**  and **autonomous mobile robots**, building pipelines that connect vision, control, and reasoning. These days, I focus on applying **multimodal AI models** at scale — from text-image understanding to agentic systems that improve content safety and automation.

## Experience

**Applied Scientist I — Amazon Ads (Jan 2024 – Present)**  

I work on large-scale AI systems for content understanding and automation.  
My focus is on building and deploying **multimodal models** that combine text and image understanding to improve content moderation efficiency across global marketplaces.  

I also explore **active learning**, **representation learning**, and **model reliability** — developing approaches that make large models more data-efficient and trustworthy.
